# Sfcalc - Scalar field calculator

### Go package to calculate gradient, divergence and rotation of a scalar field
A scalar field is a three-dimensional mathematical function describing some property of the space it occupies.
By entering a scalar field as a string, a point in the 3D-space and an approximation accuracy value, you can use the functions grad, div or rot to calculate the gradient, divergence or rotation respectivly. 

### Installation
